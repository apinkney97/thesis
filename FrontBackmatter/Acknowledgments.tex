\begin{quote}{\slshape    
    In a badly designed book, the letters mill 
    and stand like starving horses in a field.
    In a book designed by rote, they sit 
    like stale bread and mutton on the page. 
    In a well-made book, where designer, compositor
    and printer have all done their jobs, 
    no matter how many thousands of lines and pages 
    they must occupy, the letters are alive. 
    They dance in their seats. 
    Sometimes they rise and dance in the margins and aisles. }
