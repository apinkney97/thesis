\chapter{Foreword}
\setcounter{footnote}{-1}
This thesis is structured in a slightly unconventional manner:\footnote{Like all good computer scientists, we begin counting at zero} its literature review is spread amongst the chapters, and sources are discussed within relevant areas of the text. Below is an outline of the thesis structure:

\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter~\ref{ch:intro} provides an overview of the present state of affairs of the electronic document world, with particular emphasis upon the technologies used in contemporary \ebook{} readers, and their benefits and drawbacks.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:malleable} describes a novel paradigm for document representation that allows documents to fit a wide variety of screen sizes whilst maintaining high typographic quality, and outlines a prototype implementation of a system to generate and display simple documents.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:floats} introduces a complete reimplementation of the system described in Chapter~\ref{ch:malleable} to enable its use on portable devices, and extends the devised model to include support for floating items such as figures and tables.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:bloat} addresses the issue of enlarged file sizes, and details various methods to keep file sizes to a minimum.

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:analysis} provides technical and aesthetic analysis, focusing on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the system as it runs at view-time, and includes the results of a user study of the system developed in the previous chapter.

\item Finally, Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions} evaluates the success of the project, and details areas of potential new research that have been encountered throughout the process.
\end{itemize}
