\chapter{Aesthetic Analysis}\label{ch:aesthetics}


Aesthetically speaking, our system produces layouts that we feel most people would consider to be `good'. The system can guarantee use of a high-quality line breaking algorithm, since it has effectively been compiled in, and so the only remaining concern is that the columns of text and floats are laid out in a pleasing manner.

Harrington et al.~\cite{Harrington2004} identified nine aesthetic measures for automated document layout. A number of these measures (alignment, regularity, uniform separation, white-space free-flow, uniformity) are particularly well satisfied by our system, due to its use of a grid to provide regular layout.
