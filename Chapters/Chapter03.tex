\chapter{Addition of Floating Bodies}\label{ch:floats}

Required implementation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item extension of chapter 2 code to support floats
    \item tradeoffs between Plass\cite{Plass1981} pagination and `dumb' pagination. Should floats be
    `floatable'?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item how floatable?
        \item how much effort do we put in before it stops being worth it?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Floats across multiple columns?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item simple multiples of galley width/line height
    \end{itemize}
    \item Bringhurst's suggestion\cite{Bringhurst2008} of making blocks take up multiples of the
    leading to always keep text in phase (could even factor this into chapter 2 implementation)

\end{itemize}
