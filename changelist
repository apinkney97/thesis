The abstract has been rewritten.

Added data from British National Corpus to section on word frequency.

Added references where necessary.

Added evidence of the system working on mobile devices, and noted this in the text.

Moved the thesis overview from the end of chapter 1 into the new Foreword ("Chaper 0").

Added introductory summary to each chapter to put them into the context of the other chapters.

Merged chapters 5 and 6, and included the results of a new user study.

Reworded to sound more positive and less self-deprecating.

Deleted appendix A.

Moved sample layouts into an appendix.

Moved references and glossary to come before appendices.

Redid flowchart in chapter 3 to make it better aligned.

Sideways graphs/tables now have their captions rotated appropriately.

All spaces before references have been removed. (There are some instances where the reference has been pushed to the following line. If this is still a problem, I can try to reword the affected sections.)

Figure placement: I intend to print the hardbound version with smaller line spacing (probably 1.5) rather than the double spacing used in the review copies. I also intend to print it double-sided. For this reason, I've not been too concerned about where exactly the figures appear. For example, there are some figures that I want to be at the top of facing pages, eg Figures 6 and 7 (the excepts from Alice in Wonderland) and some of the graphs and data tables in later chapters. This applies wherever there are figures that need to be very close to their accompanying text and/or other figures.
